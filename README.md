# First Part:
-Generating a sinusoidal signal  
-Displaying the signal   
-Display the specter of the signal   
-Multiplying 2 sinusoidal signals together

# Second Part:
Using different algorithms to calculate the integral of a function   
Algorithms:   
-Rectangles method   
-Trapeze method   
-Simpson's method   

# Third Part
Generated these two signals using a function generator:   
-Sinusoidal signal, 5V, 1kHz frequency   
-Square signal, 5V, 100kHz frequency, 20% cyclical report

Then, displayed the specter of these signals, calculated their Amplitude   
Also calculated the effective power of these signals, as well as average power, using Parseval's theorem
